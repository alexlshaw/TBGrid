# TBGrid

## Summary

 OpenGL engine for a simple, grid-based game.


## Assets
Some assets with larger filesizes or license requirements are excluded from the repo. At the moment this includes:
- Animations  
> Data/Animation/Idle.fbx
> Data/Animation/Taunt.fbx
> Data/Animation/Female Walk.fbx
- Rigged Models  
> Data/Animation/X Bot.fbx  

These assets (or suitable equivalents) can be downloaded freely from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com). The filenames match the Mixamo name.
The assets are binary fbx, though ascii fbx should also work (untested).
