# TBGrid

## Summary

 OpenGL engine for a simple, grid-based game.


## Assets
Some assets with larger filesizes are excluded from the repo. At the moment this includes:
- Animations  
> Data/Animation/Idle.fbx
> Data/Animation/Taunt.fbx
- Rigged Models  
> Data/Animation/X Bot.fbx  

These assets (or suitable equivalents) can be downloaded freely from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com). 
The assets are binary fbx, though ascii fbx should also work.
